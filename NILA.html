	<div class="aboutnila"	><h1> Nila Jane </h1> <br><h2> Nila Jane, or just Nila, is a Dutch girl from Chaam. Her real name is Jana van Dijk. Jana was born on February 18th 1993.
Jana grew up  with the country and classic rock music of her parents. That’s how she gets to know lots of musicians and bands, amongst others Led Zeppelin & Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Jana always had a passion for music and at an early age she started to write songs of her own. She started off with country style melodies. During this period she also learned to play the guitar and the piano.
Her interest in different genres grew. She also started to listen to surf music. Her role models were Dick Dale and Roy rbison. She also got into the genre hot rod, she especially liked the rhythm of the drums.
Jana started to perform on small festivals and events but she soon came to the conclusion that live performances were not her thing. She loved making music but hated the direct contact with the audience.
That is why she went on a search for a record company who would help get her music published.
