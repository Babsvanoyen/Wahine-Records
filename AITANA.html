<div class="aboutaitana"	><h1> Aitana </h1> <br> <h2> Aitana is a surf-punk solo artist who likes to take her audience on a musical tour with her guitar. Her love for music started early. Ever since she was a young girl her parents took her out to any musical event. It’s evident that there her passion for music started.
Her name Aitana is her artist name but is also her real name. She doesn’t like the ‘Commercial Bullshit’ as she calls it, of the business world. By creating rough and tough music she seems very arrogant and self-assured but she isn’t that at all. When she’s finished her set she wants to leave the stage as soon as possible. The only thing she wants is to share her passion with people who can appreciate it. She doesn’t like the attention that comes with it.
Because she is a real performer and likes to get her music out into the world she was looking for a record label. Wahine Records perfectly fitted her needs because she wanted to keep up with the surf-genre on her punk guitar. We definitely advise you to listen to her music.
